A joint ALX-project with Chi-Naydu

Project topic- printf

Chi-Naydu and I decided to team up for this program as required by ALX, it's not our first time teaming up, we've had tutorials via google meet, so communicating was quite easy and friendly. 

We started working on this project Friday, March 24, 2023. We had a rocky start cos its our first joint project and the concept of the project seemed alien to us. We both decided to research and read more on different topics/sections of the project, Youtube was mainly our go-to for each time we got stuck and it was quite helpful. We also reached out to other collegues and had help from chat GPT which made things easier.

We created a repository which consists of 14 files which includes a README.md file, an header file which contains the prototypes used and 12 .c files.
